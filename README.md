# Community Work

> In 2022, I decided to start documenting the things I was doing related to communities
> because I was dealing with a feeling I was not doing enough.

Most of the work I have been doing in different communities.
Some of the items can be found on Github, and some other
are either in private repositories, chat platforms, and many
other sources.
